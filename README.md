## ðŸš€ Features

- Clean and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap Icons  
- Backend logic powered by Flask  
- Predicts medical insurance costs using machine learning  
- Uses trained models with **XGBoost** and **Scikit-learn** with an accuracy of 86%

---

## ðŸ§  Models and Tools Used

### ðŸ”¸ XGBoost
- A high-performance gradient boosting algorithm  
- Handles both categorical and continuous features well  
- Robust to overfitting with built-in regularization

### ðŸ”¸ Scikit-learn
- Used for data preprocessing, evaluation, and model comparison  
- Includes tools like `train_test_split`, `StandardScaler`, and various metrics

### ðŸ”¸ Pandas & NumPy
- For data manipulation and numerical operations

### ðŸ”¸ Flask
- Lightweight Python framework for web apps  
- Handles form inputs, routing, and template rendering

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. User fills out a form with age, sex, BMI, children, and smoking status  
2. The form is submitted to the Flask server via POST  
3. The backend processes the data and passes it to a trained ML model  
4. The model returns an insurance cost prediction  
5. The result is displayed back to the user

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact and Importance

This project shows how machine learning can be integrated into a real-world application with an interactive front end. Itâ€™s designed to educate users about the factors that influence insurance pricing and the power of predictive analytics.

### Why it matters:
- Increases awareness of how personal factors affect insurance costs  
- Can be used as an educational tool for data science deployment  
- Demonstrates end-to-end ML integration from model to user interface
